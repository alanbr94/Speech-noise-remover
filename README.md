It's the alpha version, follow the following steps to remove your noise background.


TUTORIAL
Unzip the dist.zip.
Put your desirable audio in the dist folder. (Your Audio may be in .wav or .mp3 format)
Execute the inference2.exe


Note:
- You need to have only one audio in the dist folder before running the program.
- After running the program, you will have an audio with the VOICE and another one with the NOISE. (in case your audio is in .mp3, you will have also an audio converted to .wav)
- Your audio doesn't need to have a specific name
- After finishing the process, move your audio for another place, in order to run the program again.
- It runs only one file a time



A better new version will be released in the next few days.
